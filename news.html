            <p class="lead" id="news-p-lead">Ten team members traveled to Barrington, Rhode Island, this past weekend (May 26th, 2018) to represent Neuqua Valley at the culminating international contest of the American Computer Science League.</p>
            <p id="news-p">The intermediate 5-person team (Bhargav Chandaka, Brett Duncan, Andy Li, Jonah Liu, and Rohan Sanjay) finished in 6th place. Additionally, they received the top programming score of 58 out of 60 points among all the intermediate teams, as well as 2 individual awards.</p>
            <p id="news-p">The senior 5-person team (Shivansh Gupta, Srikar Gutta, Jonathan Li, Bryan Qiu, and Jeffrey Tang) finished in 7th place. They were also the top-scoring team in the Western region during the regular season, and received 4 individual awards for their written test performance.</p>
            <p id="news-p">Please join us in congratulating these team members for their time (what must have been 25 hours of additional practice) and endless commitment to the team. It has certainly paid off!</p>
            <p id="news-p">In addition, a special thanks to Mr. Qiu and Mr. Duncan for being awesome chaperones during the trip. We couldn't have done it without you!</p>

We'd like to thank all our team members for their hard work and good performance; that's what resulted in our qualification. <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/152lvRrK1W37cCDw6lpz0BbaW6qd6ZATk" target="__blank">Here is a link to the relevant documents from the invitation.</a></p>

            <p id="news-p">To those who didn't, please keep in mind that your hard work and contribution to the team was invaluable this year. Thank you for your commitment, and we hope that you will continue to compete with us next year!</p>
